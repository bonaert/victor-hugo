            <p>Created a website for Brussels' network of university hospitals.
                The goal of the project is to help medicine students during their residency. When confronted with a pathology
                or a symptom, they can consult the site to discover links with other pathologies, examples, notes
                and other information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, they don't have to bring heavy and impractical dictionaries and can always easily find and access
                the information that helps them do their job.
